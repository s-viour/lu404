small win32 program to start `legouniverse.exe` and simultaneously host a local HTTP server that responds with `404 Not Found` to all TCP requests.

# usage
the program expects a file called `legouniverse.exe` to exist in the current directory. simply drop `lu404.exe` into your Lego Universe directory and run it! it'll respond with `404 Not Found` to all http requests made by the Lego Universe client.

# why use this?
no idea, but a friend of mine needed something like this because it made Lego Universe and [DarkflameServer](https://github.com/DarkflameUniverse/DarkflameServer) work!
